# SmartStudent ID: Automated Recognition and Verification System

## This project uses tensorflow object detection API and ML models to identify students from thier ID cards

Curated a comprehensive dataset of ID-card images and meticulously annotated them using LabelImg. Leveraged the Tensorflow Object Detection API to train machine learning models The models were fine-tuned to recognize and extract student images from unseen ID-cards, achieving an impressive classification accuracy of 86%. This system streamlines student identification processes by automating image extraction and accurate student recognition from ID-cards.


* After data collection the LabelImg library is used to annotate the image part of identity card
* After the model is trained it is able to extract the student image from an unseen identity card
* Different Machine learning models are traing on set of images of students so that it can classify
* Once the student image from an unseen identity card the model correctly classifies the student with an accuracy of 0.85
