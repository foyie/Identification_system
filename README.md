# Identification system

## This project uses tensorflow object detection API and ML models to identify students from thier ID cards

* After data collection the LabelImg library is used to annotate the image part of identity card
* After the model is trained it is able to extract the student image from an unseen identity card
* Different Machine learning models are traing on set of images of students so that it can classify
* Once the student image from an unseen identity card the model correctly classifies the student with an accuracy of 0.85
